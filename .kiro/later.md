HIGHER PRIORITY
* Mobile friendly
    * hide sidebar and show menu icon
    * text input placeholder cutting off
* Show some suggestion pills when session is empty

LOWER
* Automatically start building logbook on login/connect
* Bodda can be more clear about what tool it is using without bringing in jargons
* Figure out a title for each session
* Allow deleting session
* Add T&C, privacy policy, update disclaimer
* Bodda should reflect the tone of the athletes conversation like serious/casual/fun

IDEAS
* Implement some sort of wait list or mechanism to give access to the biggest and baddest model to select number of people
* Create/Export plans through tools
    * printable PDFs
    * TCX (for garmin)
* Allow people to bring their own LLM key?
