- Include splits, similar activities with activity details

- Mobile friendly
  - hide sidebar and show menu icon

IDEAS

- Create/Export plans through tools
  - printable PDFs
  - TCX (for garmin)
- Allow people to bring their own LLM key?
- Get location form profile and customize accordingly
- Detect if they are very much beginner and include terminology glossary with advice
- Use tables/charts for structured plan
