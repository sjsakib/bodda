# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will expose the existing tool execution system as a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing external MCP clients to discover and execute the tools available in the Bodda application. The MCP server will provide a standardized interface for tool discovery, schema retrieval, and tool execution while maintaining security and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to connect to the Bodda MCP server, so that I can discover available tools and their schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client connects to the server THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection using the MCP protocol
2. WHEN an MCP client requests tool discovery THEN the system SHALL return a list of all available tools with their names and descriptions
3. WHEN an MCP client requests a tool schema THEN the system SHALL return the complete JSON schema for the specified tool
4. IF a tool does not exist THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to execute tools through the MCP server, so that I can leverage Bodda's functionality remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client sends a tool execution request THEN the system SHALL validate the request parameters against the tool schema
2. WHEN parameters are valid THEN the system SHALL execute the tool using the existing tool execution infrastructure
3. WHEN tool execution completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return the result in MCP format
4. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error information
5. WHEN a tool execution times out THEN the system SHALL return a timeout error and clean up resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to integrate seamlessly with the existing tool system, so that no changes are needed to existing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL use the existing ToolRegistry to discover available tools
2. WHEN executing tools THEN the system SHALL use the existing ToolExecutor implementation
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use the existing error handling and logging infrastructure
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing tool interfaces
5. WHEN the system updates tools THEN the MCP server SHALL automatically reflect changes without restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my Strava account through the MCP server, so that I can access my personal fitness data remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client needs Strava authentication THEN the system SHALL investigate and implement appropriate authentication flow for remote MCP servers
2. WHEN a user connects their Strava account THEN the system SHALL securely store and manage authentication tokens
3. WHEN executing Strava-related tools THEN the system SHALL use the authenticated user's credentials
4. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages and guidance for re-authentication
