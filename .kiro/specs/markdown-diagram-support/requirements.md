# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI coaching application currently supports basic markdown rendering but lacks support for visual diagrams and charts. Users should be able to view Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.) and Vega-Lite visualizations (charts, graphs) when the AI coach provides responses containing these diagram formats. This enhancement will enable the AI coach to provide visual training plans, progress charts, and workflow diagrams that are much more effective than text-only explanations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user receiving AI coach responses with flowcharts and process diagrams, I want Mermaid diagrams to render as interactive visual diagrams in the chat interface, so that I can easily understand training workflows and decision trees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI coach provides Mermaid diagram code blocks THEN the chat interface SHALL render them as interactive SVG diagrams
2. WHEN Mermaid flowcharts are displayed THEN the system SHALL render them with proper styling and layout
3. WHEN Mermaid sequence diagrams are used THEN the system SHALL display them with clear participant interactions
4. WHEN Mermaid diagrams fail to parse THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to showing the raw code block
5. WHEN users interact with Mermaid diagrams THEN the system SHALL support basic zoom and pan functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user receiving training data and progress visualizations, I want Vega-Lite charts to render as interactive data visualizations in the chat interface, so that I can analyze my performance trends and training metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI coach provides Vega-Lite JSON specifications THEN the chat interface SHALL render them as interactive charts
2. WHEN Vega-Lite bar charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL render them with proper scaling and labels
3. WHEN Vega-Lite line charts show progress over time THEN the system SHALL display them with clear axes and data points
4. WHEN Vega-Lite scatter plots are used THEN the system SHALL render them with interactive tooltips
5. WHEN Vega-Lite specifications are invalid THEN the system SHALL show an error message and fall back to raw JSON display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing diagrams on different devices, I want both Mermaid and Vega-Lite visualizations to be responsive and accessible, so that I can view training diagrams clearly on mobile and desktop devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagrams are displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure they scale appropriately to fit the screen
2. WHEN diagrams are viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available space effectively
3. WHEN users zoom or pan diagrams THEN the system SHALL maintain diagram quality and readability
4. WHEN diagrams contain text elements THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable at different zoom levels
5. WHEN diagrams are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user receiving AI coach responses with various diagram types, I want consistent styling and theming for all visualizations, so that diagrams integrate seamlessly with the chat interface design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mermaid diagrams are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply consistent color schemes that match the application theme
2. WHEN Vega-Lite charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL use colors and fonts consistent with the application design
3. WHEN diagrams are shown in light mode THEN the system SHALL use appropriate light theme colors
4. WHEN the application supports dark mode THEN the system SHALL adapt diagram colors accordingly
5. WHEN multiple diagrams appear in the same response THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency between them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interacting with complex training visualizations, I want enhanced interactivity features for diagrams, so that I can explore detailed information and understand complex coaching concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vega-Lite charts contain data points THEN the system SHALL show tooltips with detailed information on hover
2. WHEN Mermaid diagrams have clickable elements THEN the system SHALL support basic interaction events
3. WHEN diagrams are large or complex THEN the system SHALL provide zoom controls for better visibility
4. WHEN users want to reference diagrams THEN the system SHALL allow copying or saving diagram images
5. WHEN diagrams contain animations THEN the system SHALL control animation playback appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user receiving AI coach responses with embedded diagrams, I want reliable and performant diagram rendering that doesn't impact chat interface responsiveness, so that my coaching experience remains smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI responses contain diagrams THEN the system SHALL render them without blocking the chat interface
2. WHEN diagram libraries are needed THEN the system SHALL lazy load Mermaid and Vega-Lite libraries only when diagram content is detected
3. WHEN multiple diagrams are present THEN the system SHALL load them efficiently without performance degradation
4. WHEN diagram rendering fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the chat
5. WHEN diagrams are being processed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
6. WHEN the chat interface is streaming responses THEN the system SHALL handle partial diagram content appropriately
7. WHEN no diagrams are present in a session THEN the system SHALL NOT load diagram libraries to maintain optimal performance
