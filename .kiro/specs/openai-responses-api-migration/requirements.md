# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current OpenAI integration from the completion API to the responses API using the official OpenAI SDK. The current implementation uses `CreateChatCompletionStream` for streaming responses, but needs to be updated to use the newer responses API pattern for better reliability, performance, and access to newer OpenAI features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from OpenAI's completion API to the responses API, so that the application uses the latest OpenAI SDK patterns and has access to improved features and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service processes a message THEN it SHALL use the OpenAI responses API instead of the completion API
2. WHEN streaming responses are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing streaming functionality using the responses API pattern
3. WHEN tool calls are executed THEN the system SHALL continue to support iterative tool calling with the new API
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle OpenAI API errors using the responses API error patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat functionality to continue working seamlessly, so that I don't experience any disruption in the coaching service during the API migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message THEN the response quality and format SHALL remain identical to the current implementation
2. WHEN the system processes my request THEN the streaming behavior SHALL maintain the same user experience
3. WHEN tool calls are needed THEN the iterative analysis process SHALL continue to work as before
4. WHEN progress messages are shown THEN they SHALL continue to appear with the same timing and content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the new API integration, so that I can be confident the migration doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all existing AI service tests SHALL pass with the new implementation
2. WHEN testing streaming functionality THEN the responses API streaming SHALL be thoroughly tested
3. WHEN testing tool execution THEN iterative tool calling SHALL be validated with the new API
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN all error handling paths SHALL be covered with the responses API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the differences between the old and new API implementations, so that I can maintain and extend the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN clear documentation SHALL explain the migration changes
2. WHEN comparing implementations THEN the key differences between completion and responses APIs SHALL be documented
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the new error handling patterns SHALL be clearly documented
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN examples of using the responses API SHALL be available
