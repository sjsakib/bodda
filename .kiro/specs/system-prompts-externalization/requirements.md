# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will move system prompts from hardcoded strings in the codebase to separate external files that can be excluded from git commits. This will allow for better prompt management, easier updates, and prevent sensitive or frequently changing prompts from cluttering the git history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to store system prompts in separate files, so that I can manage them independently from the main codebase and avoid committing them to git.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to load a prompt THEN it SHALL read the prompt content from an external file
2. WHEN a prompt file is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating which file is needed
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate that all required prompt files exist and are readable
4. IF a prompt file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate error and fail gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want prompt files to be automatically excluded from git, so that I don't accidentally commit sensitive or frequently changing prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompt files are created THEN they SHALL be automatically ignored by git through .gitignore rules
2. WHEN running git status THEN prompt files SHALL NOT appear in the list of untracked files
3. WHEN committing changes THEN prompt files SHALL NOT be included in the commit even if explicitly added

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear directory structure for prompts, so that I can easily organize and find different types of prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing prompts THEN they SHALL be stored in a dedicated directory structure
2. WHEN adding new prompts THEN the naming convention SHALL be consistent and descriptive
3. WHEN the system loads prompts THEN it SHALL support subdirectories for better organization
4. IF multiple prompt files exist for the same purpose THEN the system SHALL have a clear precedence order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example/template prompt files, so that I can understand the expected format and quickly set up new environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a new environment THEN example prompt files SHALL be available as templates
2. WHEN example files are provided THEN they SHALL contain placeholder content that demonstrates the expected format
3. WHEN copying from examples THEN the actual prompt files SHALL be created in the correct location
4. IF example files are updated THEN they SHALL remain committed to git while actual prompt files stay ignored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support different prompt files for different environments, so that I can use different prompts for development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading prompts THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific prompt files
2. WHEN an environment-specific prompt exists THEN it SHALL take precedence over the default prompt
3. WHEN no environment-specific prompt exists THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default prompt file
4. IF neither environment-specific nor default prompts exist THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate prompt file formats, so that I can catch configuration errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a prompt file THEN the system SHALL validate its format and content
2. WHEN a prompt file has invalid format THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details
3. WHEN prompt validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and log the validation errors
4. IF prompt files are valid THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation
