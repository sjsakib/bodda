# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide a flexible API endpoint that allows clients to execute any available tool with the same capabilities and behavior as an LLM would. The endpoint will accept tool specifications, parameters, and execute them dynamically, returning structured results. This enables programmatic access to tool functionality without hardcoding specific tool implementations. This endpoint will only be available in development environments for security reasons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to call an API endpoint with any tool name and parameters, so that I can execute tools programmatically without being limited to predefined endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/api/tools/execute` with a valid tool name and parameters THEN the system SHALL execute the specified tool and return the result
2. WHEN the tool execution is successful THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with the tool's output in a structured format
3. WHEN the tool name is invalid or not found THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the tool parameters are invalid or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with validation error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tool execution to be secure and only available in development environments, so that production systems remain secure from potentially dangerous operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running in production mode THEN the system SHALL disable the tool execution endpoint entirely
2. WHEN the application is running in development mode THEN the system SHALL enable the tool execution endpoint with appropriate safeguards
3. WHEN tool execution involves file system operations THEN the system SHALL enforce workspace boundaries and security constraints
4. WHEN a tool execution request contains malicious parameters THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs and reject dangerous operations
5. WHEN the endpoint is accessed in production THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code as if the endpoint does not exist

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive consistent response formats from tool executions, so that I can reliably parse and handle the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tool is executed successfully THEN the system SHALL return a response with consistent structure including status, data, and metadata
2. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL return an error response with consistent structure including error type, message, and details
3. WHEN a tool execution takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling and appropriate status updates
4. WHEN a tool produces streaming output THEN the system SHALL support both streaming and buffered response modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to discover available tools and their parameters, so that I can understand what tools I can execute and how to use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/tools` THEN the system SHALL return a list of available tools with their descriptions
2. WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/tools/{toolName}/schema` THEN the system SHALL return the parameter schema for that specific tool
3. WHEN the tool schema includes required and optional parameters THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which parameters are mandatory
4. WHEN a tool has usage examples THEN the system SHALL include sample request/response pairs in the schema response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to track tool execution metrics and logs, so that I can monitor system performance and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tool is executed THEN the system SHALL log the execution with timestamp, user, tool name, and execution duration
2. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and parameter values
3. WHEN tool execution exceeds performance thresholds THEN the system SHALL emit performance metrics and alerts
4. WHEN multiple tools are executed concurrently THEN the system SHALL track and report on resource utilization and queue status
