# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OpenAI Responses API integration is missing the `call_id` field when processing function call events. The `call_id` is present in the API response events but is not being properly extracted and used in the tool execution flow. This causes issues with tool call tracking and potentially affects multi-turn conversations and tool result correlation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to properly extract and use the `call_id` from OpenAI function call events, so that tool calls can be correctly tracked and correlated with their results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a `response.output_item.added` event with a function call item THEN the system SHALL extract the `call_id` from the nested item structure
2. WHEN processing function call arguments delta events THEN the system SHALL use the correct `call_id` for tool call identification
3. WHEN executing tools THEN the system SHALL pass the correct `call_id` to ensure proper correlation between tool calls and results
4. WHEN logging tool call events THEN the system SHALL include the `call_id` in debug and info logs for traceability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool call state management to use the correct call IDs, so that tool execution results are properly correlated with their originating calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating ToolResult objects THEN the system SHALL use the extracted `call_id` as the `ToolCallID` field
2. WHEN accumulating tool call state THEN the system SHALL use `call_id` as the primary key for tool call tracking
3. WHEN finalizing tool calls THEN the system SHALL ensure all tool calls have valid `call_id` values
4. IF a `call_id` is missing or empty THEN the system SHALL log a warning and use a fallback identification method

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of call ID extraction, so that I can debug and monitor the tool call processing pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting `call_id` from events THEN the system SHALL log the extraction process with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN `call_id` extraction fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including event structure
3. WHEN using fallback identification methods THEN the system SHALL log the reason and fallback strategy used
4. WHEN tool calls are completed THEN the system SHALL log a summary including all `call_id` values processed
