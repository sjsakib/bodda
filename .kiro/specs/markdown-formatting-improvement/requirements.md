# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI coach messages in the chat interface are currently displaying markdown content as mostly plain text instead of properly rendered markdown. Users should see formatted headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and other markdown elements when the AI coach provides responses. The focus is on improving the readability and visual presentation of AI-generated coaching content in the chat interface.

## Requirements

1. WHEN the AI coach uses markdown headings THEN the chat interface SHALL render them as proper HTML headings with appropriate styling
2. WHEN headings are displayed THEN the system SHALL apply consistent typography and spacing for visual hierarchy
3. WHEN multiple heading levels are used THEN the system SHALL render them with appropriate size differences
4. WHEN headings contain coaching topics THEN the system SHALL make them visually distinct from regular text

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user receiving coaching advice with lists, I want bullet points and numbered lists to render properly in the chat interface, so that I can easily follow structured recommendations.

4. WHEN lists contain training recommendations THEN the system SHALL make them easy to scan and follow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user receiving coaching advice with emphasis and formatting, I want bold, italic, and other text formatting to render properly in the chat interface, so that important points stand out clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI coach uses **bold text** THEN the chat interface SHALL render it as bold HTML text
2. WHEN the AI coach uses *italic text* THEN the chat interface SHALL render it as italic HTML text
3. WHEN the AI coach uses `inline code` formatting THEN the system SHALL render it with monospace font and background highlighting
4. WHEN the AI coach combines formatting styles THEN the system SHALL render them correctly together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user receiving coaching data in tables, I want markdown tables to render properly in the chat interface, so that I can easily read structured training information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI coach provides markdown tables THEN the chat interface SHALL render them as proper HTML tables with borders and styling
2. WHEN tables contain training data THEN the system SHALL ensure proper column alignment and readability
3. WHEN table headers are used THEN the system SHALL style them distinctly from table data
4. WHEN tables are displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain readable and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user receiving coaching advice with blockquotes and special formatting, I want these elements to render properly in the chat interface, so that important coaching insights are highlighted effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI coach uses blockquotes (>) THEN the chat interface SHALL render them with proper indentation and styling
2. WHEN the AI coach provides links THEN the system SHALL render them as clickable hyperlinks with appropriate styling
3. WHEN the AI coach uses horizontal rules (---) THEN the system SHALL render them as visual separators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the AI coach, I want consistent and reliable markdown rendering across all coaching responses, so that the chat interface provides a professional and readable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI coach response contains markdown THEN the system SHALL render it consistently with proper styling
2. WHEN markdown rendering fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to plain text without breaking the interface
3. WHEN new markdown features are used THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately or ignore them safely
