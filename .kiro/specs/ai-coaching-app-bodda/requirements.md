# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Bodda is an AI-powered running and cycling coach application that integrates with Strava to provide personalized coaching advice.

4. WHEN displaying AI responses THEN the system SHALL render them as formatted markdown
5. WHEN a user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL include their athlete logbook context automatically

### Requirement 4

3. WHEN a user wants to start a new session THEN the system SHALL provide a clear option to create a new conversation
4. WHEN switching between sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain the context and history of each session separately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI coach, I want access to the user's Strava activity data through tools, so that I can provide data-driven coaching recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI processes a coaching request THEN the system SHALL provide access to Strava data through function calls
2. WHEN the AI needs activity information THEN the system SHALL allow iterative tool calls to gather comprehensive data
3. WHEN Strava data is requested THEN the system SHALL return relevant activity metrics, training history, and performance data
4. IF Strava data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI coach, I want to maintain and update an athlete logbook for each user, so that I can provide consistent and evolving coaching advice across all sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user starts their first session THEN the system SHALL pass an empty logbook and instruct LLM to create a logbook
2. WHEN the AI learns new information about the athlete THEN the system SHALL provide a tool to update the logbook with free-form string content
3. WHEN starting any coaching session THEN the system SHALL include the current athlete logbook as context
4. WHEN the logbook is updated THEN the system SHALL persist the string content for future sessions
5. WHEN the logbook is created or updated THEN the system SHALL associate it with the user's athlete ID for proper data isolation
6. WHEN the AI updates the logbook THEN the system SHALL accept any string format allowing the LLM to structure the content as needed

### Requirement 7

6. WHEN tool calls fail during iteration THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue with available data

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically refresh my Strava authentication tokens, so that I can continue using the coaching service without manual re-authentication interruptions.
