## Profile (updates)
- Goal confirmed (date): Solo 180 km in ≤8:00 elapsed on Nov 1, 2025 (primary); backup any day in first week of November.
- Constraint: Must be solo.
- Route/logistics: Can arrange an almost zero-stop route; unavoidable U-turn slowdowns. Plan for brief resupplies only via stashed supplies (preferred).
- Stop strategy: Stash-based resupply to keep total stops ≤10–20 min elapsed.
- Target metric: Elapsed time (not moving time).
- Preferred long-ride days: Thursday or Friday (athlete prefers Fri this week; commute ride Sat 15–20 km easy).

## Readiness Snapshot for 180 km goal (from last 30)
Recent reference rides:
- 2025-08-14 Morning Ride (ID 15451814340): 52.73 km, 2:39 moving (3:03 elapsed), 19.8 km/h moving, Avg HR 147 bpm, Avg P ~110 W, temp ~30–31 °C.
- 2025-08-21 Morning Ride (ID 15531562840): 33.33 km, 1:47 moving (2:35 elapsed), 18.6 km/h moving, Avg HR 138 bpm, Weighted Avg P 122 W.
- 2025-08-30 Duathlon Bike – Edge file (ID 15689736104): 29.23 km, 1:13:05 moving (1:16:06 elapsed), 24.0 km/h, Avg HR 170 bpm; Work 521 kJ → Avg P ~119 W; NP 120 W; VI 1.01; Avg Cad 89.5 rpm; Avg temp 29 °C.

Coach assessment:
- Current sustainable endurance speed (HR ~140–150) on open rides: ~19–21 km/h moving in heat.
- 24.0 km/h for ~70–75 min currently costs ~170 bpm; not sustainable for 8 h. 
- Gap to goal: need to bring 22.5+ km/h moving into HR ≤155–160 for 6–8 h and minimize stop time. U-turns add a few minutes of cumulative loss—plan route to minimize count.

## 8-week build outline (cycling focus)
- Weekly structure (3–4 rides/week):
  1) Long endurance: build 3.0 h → 4.0 h → 4.75–5.25 h → 5.5–6.5 h by week 6–7 (HR 150–160). Long rides scheduled Thu/Fri whenever possible.
  2) Tempo/Sweet spot: 2×20 → 3×15–20 min @ HR 165–172 (or 75–85% FTP once power clean); 5–8 min easy between.
  3) Endurance: 90–120 min @ HR 150–160, cadence 85–95 rpm.
  4) Optional skills/aero ride: 60–90 min easy focusing on steady pedaling, position, and minimal interruptions.
- Deload/taper: Week 8 reduce volume 40–50%, include one 2–3 h endurance early week.

## Decision Gates / Benchmarks (Thu/Fri execution preferred)
- Week 4 (Sep 29–Oct 5): 100–110 km @ ≥21.0–21.5 km/h moving, HR ≤155, stops ≤10 min.
- Week 6 (Oct 13–19): 130–150 km @ ≥21.5 km/h moving, HR ≤160, stops ≤15 min.
- Week 7 (Oct 20–26) Dress rehearsal: 3 h continuous ride at 23.0–24.0 km/h moving with HR ≤160; practice fueling and route with minimal U-turns.
- If these are met, 180 km in ≤8:00 (elapsed) on Nov 1 is on track; if not, extend timeline or choose coolest day in the Nov 1–7 window.

## Fueling/Heat & Logistics for long rides
- Fuel: 60–90 g carbs/h; sodium 500–700 mg/h; fluids 500–900 ml/h depending on heat. Start early to avoid peak temps.
- Stops: stash-based resupply; aim total stop time ≤10–20 min on goal day.
- Data hygiene: Use bike computer as primary for power; 1-sec recording; manual zero-offset; correct crank length. 
- Route: Prefer out-and-back or large loops to minimize U-turns; expect 3–5 min total time loss from U-turns/accelerations if several are required.

## Target Event Plan (Nov 1, 2025)
- Pacing (elapsed-time goal):
  - 0–10 min stops → hold ~23.0 km/h moving.
  - 15–20 min stops → hold 23.2–23.5 km/h moving.
- HR caps: first 3–4 h cap at 150–156 bpm; if stable, allow 158–162 bpm later. Keep cadence 85–95 rpm.
- Stash plan: place caches every ~60–70 km (2–3 stash points) with 2–3 bottles, 120–180 g carbs, electrolytes, and spare tube/CO2; pre-open packages; quick in/out ≤3–5 min each.

# Weekend Execution – CONFIRMED (Sep 6–7, 2025)
- Sat (Sep 6): COMMUTE — 15–20 km easy recovery
  - Intensity: HR ≤145, cadence 85–95 rpm, RPE 3/10. Stay seated, smooth pedaling, no surges.
  - Hydration: 500–700 ml total. Optional 5–8 min mobility in evening.
  - Intent: keep it genuinely easy to protect Sunday’s long ride.
- Sun (Sep 7): Long Endurance 3:15–3:30
  - HR: 150–160 bpm steady.
  - Pace: target 20.5–21.0 km/h moving. 
  - Power guide: NP 110–120 W; coasting time <22% if safe.
  - Stops: practice 1 quick stash (≤3–5 min). Total stop time ≤5–8 min.
  - Fuel: 60–75 g carbs/h, sodium 500–700 mg/h, fluids 600–800 ml/h. Start early.
  - Data: zero-offset, confirm crank length, autolap 5 km + lap at resupply; press lap at start/finish of stash stop.
  - Execution checkpoints: HR drift ≤5% from first half to second; keep cadence 85–95 rpm.

## Schedule Adjustment & Recovery (Sep 5) – Updated
- Rationale: Poor sleep compromises long-ride quality; Saturday commute stays but remains recovery-only.
- Today’s guidance (Sep 5):
  - Primary: Rest, hydrate, nap if possible, evening mobility 8–10 min.
  - Optional: 30–45 min easy spin HR ≤145 OR 30–40 min brisk walk. No hard efforts.
  - If insisting on a run: cap to 20–25 min easy jog HR ≤145; stop if HR or form drifts.
- Sleep plan tonight: caffeine cutoff ≥8 h pre-bed; carb-forward dinner; screens off ≥45–60 min; cool room; aim ≥7 h.

# Week 1 Microcycle (Sep 8–14) – carries forward
- Mon (Sep 8): Off or 30–45 min very easy spin HR ≤145 + 8–10 min mobility (especially if long ride done Sun).
- Tue (Sep 9): Tempo 2×20 min @ HR 165–172 (or 75–85% FTP) with 6–8 min easy; total 75–90 min. Cadence 85–95 rpm.
- Wed (Sep 10): Rest or 30 min recovery spin HR ≤140.
- Thu (Sep 11): Endurance 90–105 min @ HR 150–160; steady pressure; minimal stops.
- Fri (Sep 12) Decision based on Sun long recovery:
  - If legs good (HR/HRV baseline, no heavy soreness, RPE ≤5): Long 2:45–3:00 @ HR 150–158; target 20.8–21.2 km/h; stops ≤5–8 min; fuel 60–75 g carbs/h.
  - If residual fatigue (elevated HR, sore, or poor sleep): Skills/aero 60–75 min easy instead; postpone the long ride to Sun (Sep 14) at 3:15–3:30 @ HR 150–160.
- Sat (Sep 13): 30–45 min recovery spin HR ≤140 or Rest.
- Sun (Sep 14): Execute long ride here only if Fri was skills/easy; otherwise keep it 60 min relaxed.

## Device & Data Hygiene (Updated)
- Primary recording for bike: Garmin Edge 540. Record at 1-sec; display 3s power, lap NP, HR, cadence, time of day.
- Zero-offset before each ride; verify correct crank length on power meter.
- To avoid conflicts, set the watch to HR-only for rides (disable power/pedals/cadence pairing on the watch) or do not start a parallel ride recording.
- Autolap: 5 km laps for day-to-day; additionally press lap at each resupply. This helps monitor drift and stop time.
- 2025-09-04 update (athlete confirmation): Power data now reads correctly from the 9/4 ride onward; Edge 540 duathlon file confirmed clean; will use Edge as primary and watch HR-only.

## Session Review – 2025-09-04 Morning Ride (ID 15689736081)
- Context: Thu opener (target 45–60 min easy with 4×2 min @ HR 155–162 + 4 short spin-ups)
- Outcome: 18.78 km in 53:42 moving (1:00:31 elapsed). Avg speed 21.0 km/h; Avg HR 142.7 bpm (Max 171 bpm); Avg cadence 85 rpm. Elev gain 63 m; Avg temp 27–31 °C.
- Power (Edge 540): Work 330 kJ → Avg P ~102 W; NP 115 W; VI 1.13. ~28.7% of time at 0 W (coasting) across mixed-traffic route.
- Stoppage: ~6:49 total stopped (elapsed – moving). Count/locations not tagged.
- HR distribution (Strava zones): 79.5% between 117–155 bpm; 17.0% between 155–174 bpm; minimal time above 165 bpm. Pattern consistent with several short excursions to 155–162 bpm as prescribed.
- Laps/splits: Lap HRs — L1 133 bpm (easy), L2 156 bpm (work intervals), L3 146 bpm (settled), L4 138 bpm (easy). Good control returning to endurance after efforts.
- Coach read: Session intent met. Majority easy (avg HR ~143) with controlled touches into the 155–162 window; no prolonged hard work. Stoppage slightly long for an opener (~6:49) but acceptable. Power now reads clean and consistent (NP > Avg as expected).
- Action points: Keep upper-end efforts capped so HR peaks ≤165–168; today max 171 bpm — a touch high for an opener. For long rides, set autolap for resupply to monitor stop time in real time; target ≤5–8 min total. Zero-offset pre-ride; confirm crank length.

## Session Review – 2025-08-30 ActivePulse Duathlon: Ride – REANALYZED
- Files compared: 
  - Bike computer (Edge 540) Morning Ride (ID 15689736104)
  - Watch (FR255) Duathlon Ride (ID 15632315313)
- Core metrics (Edge file primary): 29.23 km, 1:13:05 moving (1:16:06 elapsed), 24.0 km/h, Avg HR 170.3 bpm (max 183), Work 521 kJ → Avg P ~119 W; NP 120 W; VI 1.01; Avg Cadence 89.5 rpm; Avg temp 29 °C.
- Watch file: 29.14 km, 1:12:55 moving (1:14:45 elapsed), Avg HR 170.1 bpm; Work 554 kJ → Avg P ~127 W; NP ~117 W (Strava “Weighted Avg”), Avg Cadence 89.4 rpm; Avg temp 32 °C.
- Coasting/zero-power time: Edge ~17:39 (24%) at 0 W; Watch ~19:03 (26%) at 0 W. Indicates frequent micro-coasts/interruptions on course.
- HR drift: Early laps ~172–173 bpm, late laps 167–168 bpm (−3% drift) — suggests you managed heat/effort well or slightly eased in latter third.
- Consistency: Edge file shows NP ≈ Avg (VI 1.01) → very steady when pedaling. Watch file shows small inconsistencies and higher total work; likely sensor assignment differences when dual-recording.
- Coach read: This was a high-HR, near-threshold ride for you. Power relative to HR indicates that sustaining 24.0 km/h currently costs too much cardiovascularly for 8 h — we’ll keep it as a shorter-session intensity reference, not an all-day target.

## Strength & Mobility Plan (Sep–Nov) – Updated
As previously outlined; 2–3 short sessions per week, emphasizing core, hip/glute activation, lower-body strength, and flexibility. Avoid heavy strength within 24 h of key long/tempo sessions.

## Open Items – Updated
- Confirm start time and route for the RESCHEDULED long ride on Sun Sep 7. Share intended stash location(s).
- Morning-of-Sun check-in: sleep last night, resting HR/HRV, legs (RPE). Based on that we’ll choose Fri Sep 12 long vs. skills.
- Commute ride on Sat Sep 6 is confirmed; keep it easy as detailed above.
- Do you have access to a miniband and light resistance band for activation/posture work?
- Optional: enable lap button for each 2-min effort and each spin-up on future openers; helps verification and control.

Coach notes: Commute stays in. Keep it genuinely easy to protect Sunday’s long ride. Saturday evening: hydrate, light carb-focused dinner, early night. Sunday: start early, steady HR (150–160), minimize stops, and practice the stash. We’ll make a data-driven call mid-week on whether to add another long on Fri or slide it to Sun to preserve quality.
